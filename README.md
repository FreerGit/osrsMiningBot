Private repository to create my own custom object detection models.

##DIRS:

**Addons** is for additional software such as labelImg to create custom labeled images to train on.

**Scripts** is mainly for converting xml -> csv, csv -> .record

**Workplace** contains images, pre trained model(startpoint, checkpoint), annotations that were created with the scripts and the training folder.
